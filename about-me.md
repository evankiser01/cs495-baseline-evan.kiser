Baseline Information for CS 495 - Software Engineering 1

Step 2 
1) I have used Python, Java, HTML, C, and C#. I wouldn't say I am proficient in any of them but, have a base knowledge of each one.
2) I've coded mostly in classes. I have not coded a lot outside of classes and school projects.
3) The largest program I have worked on was my CS 222 final project, where my group built a markdown editor using Java.
4) I wouldn't say that I'm more or less comfortable with anything. I am willing to do anything and learn whatever I have to for the project.
